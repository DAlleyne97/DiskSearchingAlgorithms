An integer will be passed into the function to represent the starting position
and the list will be sorted.The function will check the differences between the
head and the values located left or right. The smallest difference will be added
to the sum and the value on the left or right will be the new head, removing the
old one. If the difference of the left and the right are equal, we will go left.
This will continue until the list has one element left.
